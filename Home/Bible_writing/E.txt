What is the Elohist?

According to the documentary hypothesis, the 
(1.) Elohist (or simply E) is one of the four source documents underlying the [[Home:01 Old Testament:Torah|Torah]],
together with the 
(2.) [[Home:Bible writing:J|Jahwist]] (or Yahwist), the 
(3.) [[Home:Bible writing:D|Deuteronomist]] and 
(4.) [[Home:Bible writing:P|Priestly]] source.

The Elohist is so named because of its pervasive use of the word Elohim to refer to the Israelist God .	[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohist|[ref 1]]]
